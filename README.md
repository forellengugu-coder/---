Hello everyone, this is a VRM model I created using Blender. After downloading it to your computer and importing it into MateEngine, the model will dance along with music. Please feel free to enjoy this desktop pet!

Since I learned everything from scratch online starting just this month, the model still has many imperfections. (For instance, I accidentally deformed the head shape and haven’t been able to fix it properly…) Therefore, I warmly welcome—and even look forward to—those of you with skills to optimize my model. This could include refining the model’s details, fixing clipping issues, or adding accessories and clothing, among other improvements.

As long as it is not for commercial purposes or used for AI training, you have my full permission to modify and adapt the model. If you choose to release a modified version based on my work, I would appreciate it if you could @me. Other than that, feel free to explore and create.

Once again, I sincerely hope that those of you who are willing will help refine this model. Thank you all!

中国的朋友如果无法通过github下载软件，可以在x上给我发私信，我直接把文件传给你。


大家好这是我使用blender制作的vrm模型，下载到电脑后导入mateengine就可以根据音乐跳舞了，请享用这份桌面宠物吧~ 因为所有的一切都是我这个月开始从网上学的，各种地方都很粗糙（这个模型的头甚至被我不小心碰到什么东西形状做的很奇怪，而且我不知道怎么改好……）所以十分欢迎大家甚至是期待大家发挥自己的才能优化我的模型——比如使模型更精细、修复穿模的bug或者添加配饰、衣物等等。只要是不商用不投喂ai，一切都是被我允许的。如果可以的话，若您是在我的模型上修改再进行发布的，希望您能在发布时提到我，除此之外百无禁忌。 再次希望大家如果愿意的话一定要帮我优化这份模型，感谢大家（其实是跪下来求你们小女子真是拿这个blender没招了）
